# Chapter 2 Designing for Operations

Place your answers below each question.  Answer are found directly in the text.

1. Why is design for operations so important?

2. How is automated configuration typically supported?

    The system must be automatically configurable. This includes both the initial setup and any further modifications. The following procedures must be able to achieve:

        * Create a backup of a configuration and restore it

        * Compare one archived copy to another revision

        * Back up the current configuration without shutting down the machine.

    All of these objectives are often met by storing the configuration in the form of a text file with a well-defined structure. Such a file may be readily generated by automated systems. Text files are simple to interpret and hence auditable. They are readily archived.

3. List the important factors for redundancy through replication.

* The service should be able to work behind a load balancer.

* Create multiple read replicas of the database.

* Software that uses a database must be specifically engineered to support readonly
replicas.

* It is good practice to segregate read-only and write/update queries even if the database does not have any replicas and both connections go to the same server.

* Create read-only replicas for specific purposes.

4. Why might you not want to solve an issue by coding the solution yourself?

5. Which type of problems should appear first on your priority list?

6. Which factors can you bring to an outside vendor to get the vendor to take your issue seriously?

* Always raise the visibility of your issues in a constructive way, as vendors are
sensitive to criticism of their products. For example, write a postmortem report that
includes the feature request so that the vendor can see the context of the request.
